10,10.1177/20539517221078823,Organizing an “organizationless” protest campaign in the WeChatsphere,Big Data &amp; Society,2022,"<jats:p> The introduction of digital technologies in collective actions seems to have transformed the dynamics of movement organizing and enabled divergent forms of protest organizing. While some studies emphasize “organizationless” organizing in which traditional organizational forms—social movements organizations and formal-bureaucratic structures—have been pushed into the margins, other studies showcase how traditional forms have assumed alternative features, for example, connective leadership and organizations with fluid boundaries. While existing research correctly points out the evolving organizing dynamics and forms in digital activism, few studies have accounted for why digitally enabled protests take certain organizing forms over others among multiple modes of interaction between protesters and digital technologies. Using a case study of a protest campaign organized by Chinese American immigrants, this study illustrates why immigrant activists struggled to keep the campaign “organizationless” on WeChat, a China-based digital platform that afforded other forms of organizing over such an organizing mode. Building on the mechanism-based approach in social movement studies, the findings show that immigrant activists’ emotional–cognitive responses to the changing digital environments became the driving force behind the relational choices to maintain the protest “organizationless.” The study, therefore, may not only inform future studies to explore why certain structures of protest networks emerge and develop but also contribute to the mechanism-based approach by foregrounding emotional–cognitive mechanisms, which mediate environmental and relational mechanisms. </jats:p>",CSS,https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517221078823,1
13,10.1177/20539517211070698,Why Personal Dreams Matter: How professionals affectively engage with the promises surrounding data-driven healthcare in Europe,Big Data &amp; Society,2022,"<jats:p> Recent buzzes around big data, data science and artificial intelligence portray a data-driven future for healthcare. As a response, Europe's key players have stimulated the use of big data technologies to make healthcare more efficient and effective. Critical Data Studies and Science and Technology Studies have developed many concepts to reflect on such overly positive narratives and conduct critical policy evaluations. In this study, we argue that there is also much to be learned from studying how professionals in the healthcare field affectively engage with this strong European narrative in concrete big data projects. We followed twelve hospital-based big data pilots in eight European countries and interviewed 145 professionals (including legal, governance and ethical experts, healthcare staff and data scientists) between 2018 and 2020. In this study, we introduce the metaphor of dreams to describe how professionals link the big data promises to their own frustrations, ideas, values and experiences with healthcare. Our research answers the question: how do professionals in concrete data-driven initiatives affectively engage with European Union's data hopes in their ‘dreams’ – and with what consequences? We describe the dreams of being seen, of timeliness, of connectedness and of being in control. Each of these dreams emphasizes certain aspects of the grand narrative of big data in Europe, makes particular assumptions and has different consequences. We argue that including attention to these dreams in our work could help shine an additional critical light on the big data developments and stimulate the development of responsible data-driven healthcare. </jats:p>",CSS,https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517211070698,1

Drawing on the study of Large Technical Systems (LTS), on the work of historian Bertrand Gille, and on the economics of General Purpose Technologies (GPTs), it outlines a way to study the “tech” in “big tech” more attentively, looking for compatibilities, synergies, and dependencies between the technologies created and deployed by these companies. Using Google as example, the paper shows how to interrogate software and hardware through the lens of transversal applicability, discusses software and hardware integration, and proposes the notion of “data amalgams” to contextualize and complicate the notion of data. The goal is to complement existing vectors of “big tech” critique with a perspective sensitive to the specific materialities of specific technologies and their possible consequences. </jats:p>",CSS,https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517221135162,1

In the context of emerging big data approaches, I consider the sociotechnical relationships between material construction of data and information infrastructures for collecting and research. Analysis is inspired by Star and Griesemer's historical case of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology which reveals how boundary objects and methods standardization are used to enroll actors in the work of collecting for natural history. I extend these concepts by pairing them with frameworks for studying digital materiality and the representational qualities of data artifacts. Through examples drawn from fieldwork observations studying two data-centered research projects, I consider how the materiality of the WARC format influences research methods and approaches to data extraction, selection, and transformation. Findings identify three modalities researchers use to configure WARC data for researcher needs: using indexes to support search queries, constructing derivative formats designed for certain types of analysis, and generating custom-designed datasets tailored for specific research purposes. Findings additionally reveal similarities in how these distinct methods approach automated data extraction by relying upon the WARC's standardized metadata elements. By interrogating whose information needs are being met and taken into account in the design of the WARC's underlying information representation, I reveal effects on the emerging field of web history, and consider alternative approaches to knowledge production with archived web data. </jats:p>",CSS,https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517231163172,1
5,10.1177/20539517231182402,Data infrastructure studies on an unequal planet,Big Data &amp; Society,2023,"<jats:p> In this article, I take the case of data centers as a powerful tool and infrastructure of multinational digital capitalism, analyzing the ways in which understanding these and other data infrastructures through their energy frameworks allows us to theorize the implications of planetary environmental impacts of digital data for contemporary subjects beyond individual data technologies themselves. This is especially true in data centers’ function as energy vacuums and in their carbon and extractive footprints and other environmental externalities. I demonstrate that data centers organize an assemblage of environmental relations whose operations reproduce uneven systems of capitalism enacted through energy and environmental politics. While this article is by no means comprehensive, and by necessity must be selective in its engagement with key texts in a number of overlapping fields, it broadly draws from media studies, geographical, and sociological approaches to data infrastructures to unravel the entanglements of digital systems and the environment. Data centers and their energy connections represent multivalent sites and indications into the global supply chain of data infrastructure, and their extractive dynamic as networked infrastructure fundamentally changes how we need to see their impacts and the impacts of datafication more broadly. </jats:p>",CSS,https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517231182402,1

However, as research using social media data has increased, so too has public scrutiny, highlighting the need to develop ethical approaches to social media data use. Prior work in this area has explored users’ perceptions of researchers’ use of social media data in the context of a single platform. In this paper, we expand on that work, exploring how platforms and their affordances impact how users feel about social media data reuse. We present results from three factorial vignette surveys, each focusing on a different platform—dating apps, Instagram, and Reddit—to assess users’ comfort with research data use scenarios across a variety of contexts. Although our results highlight different expectations between platforms depending on the research domain, purpose of research, and content collected, we find that the factor with the greatest impact across all platforms is consent—a finding which presents challenges for big data researchers. We conclude by offering a sociotechnical approach to ethical decision-making. This approach provides recommendations on how researchers can interpret and respond to platform norms and affordances to predict potential data use sensitivities. The approach also recommends that researchers respond to the predominant expectation of notification and consent for research participation by bolstering awareness of data collection on digital platforms. </jats:p>",CSS,https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517231164108,1
20,10.1177/20539517231206806,Digital resignation and the datafied  welfare state,Big Data &amp; Society,2023,"<jats:p> This commentary calls for further research into digital resignation within non-market contexts, particularly in relation to the datafied welfare state, as distinct from commercial big tech platforms. We aim to nuance the concept of digital resignation by relating it to the digitization of institutions and public services upholding the Danish welfare state, including health services, childcare, and news consumption. These cases illustrate that datafication stimulates citizens’ discomfort by registering privacy-intrusive information and setting new standards for being a good citizen, which resignation research can help us understand. We use the case examples to propose new avenues for digital resignation research and question whether organizations, institutions, and governments themselves can be digitally resigned. As such, the usefulness of digital resignation as a concept can be expanded. </jats:p>",CSS,https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517231206806,1

AI assistants such as Siri and Alexa, while helpful, can obscure decision-making and contribute to increased energy use and CO2 emissions. The present study explores whether consumers prioritize transparency and environmental sustainability over performance when choosing AI assistants with conjoint designs. Japanese participants were presented with different AI assistant profiles, varying in performance quality, transparency, cost, and environmental efficiency. The results revealed that Japanese participants prioritized transparency over performance when choosing AI assistants, but they prioritized performance over environmental sustainability. Moreover, future-oriented participants placed more importance on sustainability than those with a present orientation, while participants with an internal locus of control valued transparency more than those with an external locus of control. The findings of this study enhance our understanding of how consumers choose AI options and offer valuable guidance for creating AI systems and communication strategies that work effectively. </jats:p>",CSS,https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517241290217,1
11,10.1177/20539517241249447,Generating reality and silencing debate: Synthetic data as discursive device,Big Data &amp; Society,2024,"<jats:p> In addition to tapping data from users’ behavioral surplus, by drawing on generative adversarial networks, data for artificial intelligence is now increasingly being generated through artificial intelligence. With this new method of producing data synthetically, the data economy is not only shifting from “data collection” to “data generation.” Synthetic data is also being employed to address some of the most pressing ethical concerns around artificial intelligence. It thereby comes with the sociotechnical imaginary that social problems can be cut out of artificial intelligence, separating training data from real persons. In response to this technical solutionism, this commentary aims to initiate a critical debate about synthetic data that goes beyond misuse scenarios such as the use of generative adversarial networks to create deep fakes or dark patterns. Instead, on a more general level, we seek to complicate the idea of “solving,” i.e., “closing” and thus “silencing” the ethico-political debates for which synthetic data is supposed to be a solution by showing how synthetic data itself is political. Drawing on the complex connections between recent uses of synthetic data and public debates about artificial intelligence, we therefore propose to consider and analyze synthetic data not only as a technical device but as a discursive one as well. To this end, we shed light on their relationship to three pillars that we see associated with them (a) algorithmic bias, (b) privacy, (c) platform economy. </jats:p>",CSS,https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517241249447,1

However, there is a lack of consensus on the potential of common ‘best practices’ to resolve agricultural data governance challenges and achieve data justice. To explore these complex dynamics, we present analysis from 40 workshops, conferences, and community dialogue events related to digital agricultural technologies and data governance between 2020 and 2023, involving the participation of farmers, farming organizations, government policy and programs staff, civil society, and academic researchers. We use a data justice lens to reorient the treatment of data governance challenges and approaches. We apply multiple dimensions of justice to examine the power relations and capabilities of diverse agri-food system actors to navigate the changing landscape of agricultural datafication. We find that many common practices in agricultural data governance have fundamental limitations to achieving data justice. Overcoming these limitations will require structural change, including new laws and regulatory frameworks, novel governance structures, capacity building, and solidarity across movements.</jats:p>",CSS,https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517251330182,1

Our analysis shows the existence of a Granger-causality between the time series of developers’ emotions and Bitcoin/Ethereum price.

Cities all over the world invest in biking infrastructure, including bike lanes, bike parking racks, shared (dockless) bike systems etc. However, one of the critical factors in converting city-dwellers to (regular) bike users/commuters is safety. In this work, we utilize bike accident data from different cities to model the biking safety based on street-level (geographical and infrastructural) features. Our evaluations indicate that our model provides well-calibrated probabilities that accurately capture the risk of a biking accident. We further perform cross-city comparisons in order to explore whether there are universal features that relate to cycling safety.

To apply these methods, it is necessary to infer transition matrices that formalize the underlying stochastic process in an observed graph. For weighted graphs, where weighted edges capture observations of repeated interactions between nodes, it is common to estimate the entries of such transition matrices based on the (relative) weights of edges. However in real-world settings we are often confronted with incomplete data, which turns the construction of the transition matrix based on a weighted graph into an <jats:italic>inference problem</jats:italic>. Moreover, we often have access to additional information, which capture topological constraints of the system, i.e. which edges in a weighted graph are (theoretically) possible and which are not. Examples include transportation networks, where we may have access to a small sample of passenger trajectories as well as the physical topology of connections, or a limited set of observed social interactions with additional information on the underlying social structure. Combining these two different sources of information to reliably infer transition matrices from incomplete data on repeated interactions is an important open challenge, with severe implications for the reliability of downstream network analysis tasks.</jats:p><jats:p>Addressing this issue, we show that including knowledge on such topological constraints can considerably improve the inference of transition matrices, especially in situations where we only have a small number of observed interactions. To this end, we derive an analytically tractable Bayesian method that uses repeated interactions and a topological prior to perform data-efficient inference of transition matrices. We compare our approach against commonly used frequentist and Bayesian approaches both in synthetic data and in five real-world datasets, and we find that our method recovers the transition probabilities with higher accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the method is robust even in cases when the knowledge of the topological constraint is partial. Lastly, we show that this higher accuracy improves the results for downstream network analysis tasks like cluster detection and node ranking, which highlights the practical relevance of our method for interdisciplinary data-driven analyses of networked systems.</jats:p>",CSS,https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-023-00416-3,1

          <jats:p>Changes in individual and institutional financial behavior leading to shifts in liquidity flows often depend on events reflected in news. However, the task of establishing relationship between financial behavior and news remains challenging and understudied. We propose a news-based feature generation approach that allows accounting for news events in liquidity flow time-series predicting tasks, thereby improving the forecasting quality. These features are constructed as different types of entropies and calculated at different levels of text abstraction based on word counts, TF-IDF values, probabilistic topics, and contextual embeddings. We show that this feature engineering procedure is effective for predicting changes in two types of liquidity flows: stock market trading volume and the volume of ATM cash withdrawals. As the first type, we use our original collection of 651, 208 business news articles from a Russian news agency dating to 2013-2021 to predict abnormal jumps in the trade volume of 32 leading Russian companies. With our approach, 97% of them experience an increase in the quality of predicting the differences in daily trading volumes from their median values. For the ATM withdrawals task, we test the impact of economic news from three leading Russian media sources (N = 55, 712) on withdrawals from 100 ATMs located in Moscow. For 95% of them we improve the quality of prediction of year-to-year weekly withdrawal volume change. Additionally, we find that some news sources have a higher predictive power than others. The approach is potentially generalizable for other domains of financial behavior across the globe.</jats:p>",CSS,https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-025-00535-z,1

We find that people use clothes to make inferences about happiness, sexual interest, intelligence, trustworthiness, and confidence. Second, we examine consensus (i.e., interrater agreement) for clothing-based inferences (Study 2). We observe that characteristics of the inferring observer contribute more to the drawn inferences than the observed clothes, which entails low to medium levels of interrater agreement. Third, the current work examines whether a computer vision model can use image properties (i.e., pixels alone) to replicate human inferences (Study 3). While our best model outperforms a single human rater, its absolute performance falls short of reliability conventions in psychological research. Finally, we introduce a large database of clothing images with psychological labels and demonstrate its use for exploration and replication of psychological research.

We use data from two major news outlets, BBC and New York Times, where the number of user comments can be used as a proxy of news impact. We find that the impact dynamics of online news articles does not exhibit popularity patterns found in many other social and information systems. In particular, we find that a simple exponential distribution yields a better fit to the empirical news impact distributions than a power-law distribution. This observation is explained by the lack or limited influence of the otherwise omnipresent rich-get-richer mechanism in the analyzed data. The temporal dynamics of the news impact exhibits a universal exponential decay which allows us to collapse individual news trajectories into an elementary single curve. We also show how daily variations of user activity directly influence the dynamics of the article impact.

The risk Co-De model proposes four macro-categories that include nine micro-categories defining the stance towards risk, ranging from Consciousness to Denial (Co-De). To assess its effectiveness, a total of 2381 Italian tweets related to risk events (such as the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change) were manually annotated by four experts according to the risk Co-De model, creating a training set. Each category was then explored to assess its peculiarity by detecting co-occurrences and observing prototypical tweets classified as a whole. Finally, machine learning algorithms for classification (Support Vector Machine and Random Forest) were trained starting from a text chunks x (multilevel) features matrix. The Support Vector Machine model trained on the four macro-categories achieved an overall accuracy of 86% and a macro-average F1 score of 0.85, indicating good performance.

Although research already examined sociodemographic profiles of older internet (non-)users, it is unknown how combinations of sociodemographic factors relate to internet (non-)use. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the cumulative impact of sociodemographic characteristics on internet (non-)use among people aged 60 and older between 2004 and 2021, using representative survey data derived from the Belgian Ageing Studies (n = 61 376). Logistic regression analyses consistently associated low education, age 80 or older, low income and female gender with higher probabilities of being internet non-user between 2004 an 2021. CHAID analysis revealed that education and age are the strongest predictors of non-use. The cumulative impact of sociodemographic factors enables to reveal subgroups where prevalence rates of non-use are almost three times higher than the prevalence reported in the population of older people in general. The result that 80.1 percent of individuals aged 80 and above with limited education did not use the internet underscores the need for a comprehensive digital inclusion approach, including strategies to overcome economic barriers to internet access and tailored internet training initiatives addressing digital skills and motivation. CHAID results help policymakers and internet training providers identify subgroups with high prevalence rates of non-users and target interventions to those at a high risk of digital exclusion.

Adopting culturally responsive technology-based pedagogies that recognize and accommodate students' diverse learning needs, styles, and experiences is crucial in challenging epistemic justice and improving learning outcomes. The objective was to explore how integrating an understanding of individual students' distinctive traits into developing technology-based pedagogies informed by students' different ways of knowing can increase learning outcomes. In this article, I discuss how adopting culturally responsive technologies in classrooms can redress epistemic injustice and improve learner outcomes by promoting student engagement, hands-on experiential learning, and culturally aware learning. The concept of epistemic justice inspires efforts to enhance learning environments and cultivate a sense of connection and community among students. The cases draw from my experience adopting the intervention and are presented within an analytical framework of culturally responsive technology-based pedagogies in selected hybrid and in-person media production courses.

This paper presents a novel methodological framework for studying mobilization strategies of far-right groups on TikTok, employing a mixed-method approach that combines manual annotation, unsupervised image classification, and named-entity recognition to analyze the dynamics of radical visuals at scale. Differentiating between internal and external mobilization, we use popularity and engagement cues to investigate far-right mobilization efforts on TikTok within and outside their community. Our findings shed light on the effectiveness of unsupervised image classification when utilized within a broader mixed-method framework, as each observed far-right group employs unique platform characteristics. While Conspiracists flourish in terms of overall popularity and internal mobilization, nationalist and protest content succeeds by using a variety of persuasive visual content to attract and engage external audiences. The study contributes to existing literature by bridging the gap between visual political communication at scale and radicalization research. By offering insights into mobilization strategies of far-right groups, our study provides a foundation for policymakers, researchers, and online platforms to develop proactive measures to address the risks associated with the dissemination of extremist ideologies on social media.</jats:p>",SS,https://doi.org/10.33621/jdsr.v6i1.200,1

Many of the groups supporting growth have banded together under the banner of the ‘Yes in My Backyard’ (YIMBY) movement which seeks fewer zoning laws and pushes for market-rate rental housing. In desirable cities with thriving job opportunities, housing costs are pricing out not only low-income renters but also the middle class. The millennial activists sampled blame baby boomers for the lack of affordable housing because of resistance to higher density construction in neighbourhoods with single-family homes (characterising these people as having a ‘Not in My Backyard’ [NIMBY] mindset). The research shows that boomers and millennials not only disagree over urban growth but also more fundamental questions of what makes a liveable city. </jats:p>",SS,https://doi.org/10.1177/0038026120916121,1
30,10.1177/0038026120905472,Moving on with <i>saudade</i>: On bordered countries and vague terms,The Sociological Review,2020,"<jats:p> This article is about how people moving along state borders – I call them wayfarers – refuse the assumption that they ought to live either a sedentary or a nomadic lifestyle inside or outside states, whether as citizens or as Others. In particular, it looks at how the term saudade helps mobile people to manage friction without falling back into such binaries. The Oxford English Dictionary defines saudade as a desire ‘for something’ and describes it as a characteristic of the ‘Portuguese or Brazilian’ people. Here, we shall attend however to the saudade evoked by Venezuelans and Warao (defined by the same dictionary as ‘members of a South American Indian people inhabiting Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela’). This article patterns a contrast between two ways of evoking the term in comments about movement made by my informants: the first, Precise Saudade, asks for precision about that of which people feel saudade. The second way of evoking the term, Vague Saudade, is, as its name suggests, more comfortable with being vague. The argument put forward by this article is that scholarly and policy texts on ‘migrants’, ‘nomads’ and ‘refugees’ need to make more room for Vague Saudade when translating the talk of wayfarers. It may be tempting to dismiss vagueness as showing ambiguity and imprecision. Yet, as the stories that follow are meant to highlight, Vague Saudade can be useful to wayfarers in several ways: to engage in care, to protect others, to protect themselves and to engage in conversations about alternative worlds. To grant monopoly to Precise Saudade, it is argued, risks hindering wayfarers’ ability to do these things. I find this is relevant to how we translate wayfarers, and I suggest it is also germane to how we translate in research. </jats:p>",SS,https://doi.org/10.1177/0038026120905472,1

The study of the Algerian sociologist Abdelmalek Sayad offers insights into the social conditions of this mode of committed scholarship. On the one hand, this article applies Sayad’s theory of immigration to his transnational intellectual engagements. It establishes how immigrants’ intellectual work are conditioned by their trajectories, both before and after leaving their country, and by the stages of emigration (from playing a role in the society of origin to becoming caught up in the reality of the host society). On the other hand, the article illuminates the constraints and the spaces of possible action intellectuals face while moving across national universes and disparate political and academic fields. Sayad’s marginal position within the academy constrained him to work for the French and Algerian governments and international organizations while he was simultaneously engaged with political dissidents, unionists, writers, and social movements. In tracking Sayad’s roles as an academic, expert and public sociologist, the article uncovers the conditions that grounded improbable alliances between those fields and produced new forms of critique and political action. The article concludes by drawing out some reflections that ‘collective intellectual’ engagements elicit to the sociology of intellectuals. </jats:p>",SS,https://doi.org/10.1177/0038026119900104,1

First, to explore the different meanings that the polysemic term ‘strategy’ can hold in relation to intellectuals. In the process, we showcase both this concept’s potential theoretical yield and its capacity to bridge the ‘performative’ and event-oriented study of intellectuals more common in English-speaking sociology with longue durée career-oriented analyses more associated with French sociology. The second objective is to reassess some of the main contributions to the sociology of intellectuals by reference to this notion of ‘strategy’, especially concerning issues of political allegiance and group membership. The final objective is to illustrate the potential of this approach in empirical work on intellectual engagement and introduce the articles that comprise the Special Section. </jats:p>",SS,https://doi.org/10.1177/0038026120931422,1

Reclaiming gender normativities in zero waste living,The Sociological Review,2022,"<jats:p> Growing awareness of environmental issues and their relation to consumption patterns has given rise to calls for sustainable consumption across the globe. In this article, we focus on the zero waste lifestyle movement, which targets high-consumption households in the Global North as a site of change for phasing out waste in global supply chains. Our article is concerned with asking how gender and household sustainability are mutually constituted in the zero waste lifestyle movement. We establish an analytical tension between understanding zero waste living as a further intensification of feminised responsibility for people and the planet and as offering potential for transformational change – as feminised concern or feminist care. Through qualitative content analysis of the 10 most influential zero waste blogs globally, we show how the five zero waste rules of conduct – refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle, and rot – guide consumers towards everyday and situated engagements with waste. Organised by three cross-cutting themes – communing with nature, organising time, and spending money – we present the normativities these rules call into being for reconfiguring domestic activities such as cooking, cleaning, and grocery shopping. In the discussion, we draw out the implications of zero waste living’s emerging, contradictory gender normativities, while recalling the political economy in which it is situated, namely a neoliberal, postfeminist landscape. We identify a continued feminisation of domestic responsibilities that is uncontested in zero waste living but also explore the progressive potential of waste-free living to bring collective, naturecultural worlds into being as part of domestic environmental labour. </jats:p>",SS,https://doi.org/10.1177/00380261221080110,1

Starting with William James’s diagnosis of the hold the idea of ‘progress’ has over us, and following his proposition that this idea is at work in the world itself, in the ecological and social ravages that it guides and justifies, this article aims to analyse the political and speculative effects of the notion of progress and to propose, through what we call an ‘ecology of trust’, other ways of collectively composing our modes of existence. </jats:p>",SS,https://doi.org/10.1177/00380261221084794,1

This is the widely practised habit of turning over a piece of ceramic ware, in situations away from home, to examine its origins. While on the surface, this practice is ostensibly to check the backstamp (the maker’s mark) that identifies its origins, I argue that it has a number of deeper meanings and resonances. What those who are not local often only understand as a question of antique provenance or value, my work shows that this practice carries with it broader meanings of the material culture of pottery-in-use, complex conceptions of the locality, as part of wider socio-cultural narratives of Stoke-on-Trent. In this article, I address the critical, theoretical context in which this turning over practice might also be understood as marking, feeling and resisting socio-historical change. Drawing on both qualitative, empirical data and interdisciplinary theoretical work on affects, ritual/material culture and hauntology, the article suggests the complex and often conflicted role that turning over plays is part of a response to de-industrialisation in Stoke-on-Trent. In recognising this specific micro-practice in this context of cultural troubling/haunting, the article proposes object-focused rituals may operate homologically to ‘turn over’ locality. </jats:p>",SS,https://doi.org/10.1177/00380261231182521,1

These strategies mobilise a technology of detection which draws police ever more intently into the orbit of the sexual and sexual violation and in ever-closer proximity to the genital, the vaginal and the anal cavities of those it forcibly produces as suspects. I am especially interested in the symbolic, spectacular, gendered and performative dimensions of these ‘devices of sexual saturation’; their opportunistic deployment to patrol minoritarian populations (Aboriginal people, young people/minors, sexual and racial minorities) and cast aspersions on their self-sovereign capacities. Framed by the law as technologies of drug detection, these operations are better conceptualised as technologies of abjection devoted to the production of violable subjects as part of brutal ongoing efforts to shore up the authority of self-asserted, stolen sovereignty. A narcofeminist lens brings these gendered dimensions of drug policing into better view. Here, the ‘possessive logics’ that Aileen Moreton-Robinson implicates in the performativity of patriarchal white sovereignty on the part of the ‘postcolonising’ Australian state find their pretext and source of legitimation in the rhetoric of drugs and the fantasised sovereign subject it maintains as a requirement for the general functioning of the law: the ‘master of her intentions and desires’, in Derrida’s words. This mobilisation of technologies of abjection under the guise of drug enforcement is part of a longer story about the racialisation of sexuality and the sexualisation of race as biopolitical trajectories that naturalise and maintain settler-colonialism and its worlds. Countering their violence entails forging new solidarities among minoritarian constituencies that articulate, affirm and reactivate the non-sovereign potentials/performatives that inhere in our mutual vulnerability and relationally-constituted capacity for endurance. </jats:p>",SS,https://doi.org/10.1177/00380261231174969,1

The neoliberalisation process in universities has strengthened centralised leadership and increased the power of managers. Simultaneously, the market-driven competitive ethos has deepened the binary between ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ at all levels of academia, giving rise to an affectively tense atmosphere. Due to their increased power, managers play a key role in shaping the affective milieu of academia. By using an affective-discursive approach, I analyse what kind of emotions deans rely on while constructing their relation to employees. This study traces three management discourses: strong, paternalistic and collegial. Together, these discourses with their affective orientations construct a polarised affective milieu. On the one hand, the deans’ affective relationships with employees embody gentleness, care and compassion; on the other hand, affective relationships manifest the inducement of guilt, sternness, conventionality, distance and detachment of employees. I argue that current neoliberal academia leaves little space for deans to demonstrate compassionate collegial management. </jats:p>",SS,https://doi.org/10.1177/00380261231189050,1

The temporal interactions between Brexit and people’s daily lives, whether through the constant low-level simmering presence of the issue, the impactful moments when Brexit ‘boils over’ into family life, or a more profound relationship with the substance of Brexit politics, offer a lens through which we can understand how politics and other socio-economic events of (inter)national significance are lived in the context of everyday personal lives. The resonance of this analysis applies beyond Brexit and contributes to political sociology more broadly as well as to sociologies of everyday personal life. </jats:p>",SS,https://doi.org/10.1177/00380261241260112,1

States have raised the bars for naturalization and lowered the threshold for denaturalization, creating new hierarchies of deservingness. While researchers have studied how prospective citizens navigate these hierarchies, the experiences of to-be-denaturalized individuals have remained nearly untouched. Based on interviews with 28 individuals who had immigrated to Norway from Somalia, Palestine, and various Asian countries and were accused of ‘cheating’ their way to Norwegian citizenship, this article examines how they respond to this accusation and (re)position themselves vis-a-vis the law, the state, and the national collective. Analytically, I use the concept of interpellation, which captures how individuals are transformed into subjects through being named by social institutions. I argue that citizenship revocation functions by calling naturalized citizens to become foreigners through the accusation of cheating. Rather than seeing it as a mechanical process, I highlight how the interviewees actively positioned themselves in it. The analysis distinguishes between three positions: (1) the sinners, who expressed guilt and submitted to the authority of the immigration law; (2) the saints, who admitted to minor wrongdoings but felt mis-interpellated, as they aligned themselves with welfare state virtues; and (3) the racialized scapegoats, predominantly Somali interviewees who refused to accept the premises of the interpellation, situating citizenship revocation within Norway’s history of minority scapegoating and expulsion. The article argues that these subject positions speak to different facets of Norway’s history as well as the hierarchical and racialized contours of citizenship. </jats:p>",SS,https://doi.org/10.1177/00380261241307583,1

We draw on the primacy of this exchange to explore the complexities of living with lung cancer amidst the enduring social challenge of stigma and the advent of ‘targeted therapies’ at the cutting edge of precision medicine. Lung cancer’s association with smoking and resulting stigmatisation of those with lung cancer has been well documented – positioning those with lung cancer as failed subjects of a biopolitics of lifestyle. However, recent developments in ‘precision medicine’ have drawn attention to alternate, genetic causes of lung cancer, disrupting easy equivalences between deviant cells (malignancy) and deviant conduct (smoking). Despite this, and drawing on interviews with 32 people receiving targeted therapy for lung cancer in Australia, we identify enduring resonances of deviance and stigma which still foreground individual lifestyle and blame, even for those – like many participants in this study – who have never smoked. Even in the context of uncertain causal origins and genetic mutations, the stigma of lung cancer and the figure of ‘the smoker’ as an object of abjection and disavowal persists. We find Alaimo’s concept of transcorporeality instructive for moving away from this biopolitics of lifestyle, toward greater recognition of the collective, though unequal, conditions of ‘carcinogenic capitalism’ in which we all must live and breathe. In turn, our analysis of the specificities of lung cancer may inform broader sociological approaches to tackle stigma at a structural level. </jats:p>",SS,https://doi.org/10.1177/00380261241279641,1

            winner Nadiya Hussain as a catalyst for exploration, we consider young British Muslim women’s attitudes and practices towards the turbanisation of the hijab and the politics of respectability. Drawing on focus group data with young Muslim women based in London, England, we examine this sartorial practice, which Nadiya Hussain represents in her celebrity career, and argue two overlapping points. First, the adoption of a turban style of hijab is considered by our participants to be a more contemporary form of veiling, and more palatable to white and non-Muslim audiences. It is perceived to obscure their religious identity, affording them a greater level of respectability, enabling them to traverse often burdensome representations of their faith, racialisation and Islamophobia encountered in the public sphere. Second, while the turban allows for respectability in the context of white society, the women doubt if it is ‘proper hijab’, and thus turbanisation presents a potential challenge to their religious respectability. As such, the article contributes to theoretical debates concerning respectability and appearance, showcasing the complexity of managing the expectations of religious practice and white society for young British Muslim women. It reveals the significance of turbanisation as a tool for acquiescing and merging into the dominant white society for these women, and it emphasises the intersections between fashion, celebrity, religion and race.

In this article, I develop a sociological critique of this pedagogisation of citizenship. I do so through an ethnography of the German civic education sector. I outline that, since 1945, a large state-funded civic education agenda has recast German citizenship as a project of spiritual becoming. Relying on pedagogical techniques of intimate self-exploration, affective self-revelation and physical embodiment, civic educators strive to cultivate their students’ ethical personhood. Preoccupied with enabling every citizen to display personal uprightness in the face of threats to democracy, this pedagogy runs on moralising ideals of ethical exemplarity and martyrological self-sacrifice. Theoretically, my analysis advances existing conceptualisations of contemporary European citizenship regimes. If scholars have often understood these regimes as a (Foucauldian) governmentality, crucial questions remain about how this governmentality infiltrates civic subjectivities, and how citizen-subjects agentively embrace this governmentality as authoritative for their own lives. I argue that, by drawing on Michel Foucault’s writings on spirituality and conversion, we can address these lacunae. This not only closes a gap in governmentality studies and the political sociology of citizenship, it also provides a fresh take on fundamental questions of structure and agency in the social sciences – highlighting how people agentively inhabit governing practices that spell their own subjection.</jats:p>",SS,https://doi.org/10.1177/00380261251376960,1

While Porto Maghera was an important setting for the early activism of influential theorists such as the post-workerist Antonio Negri and the autonomist feminist Mariarosa Dalla Costa, the theories produced by the workers themselves have been largely forgotten. Yet, this experience was remarkable because it involved workers employed by polluting industries denouncing in words and actions the environmental degradation caused by their companies from as early as 1968, when the workerists had a determining influence in the local factories. The Porto Marghera struggles against noxiousness contradict the widespread belief that what is today known as working-class environmentalism did not have much significance in the labour unrest of Italy’s Long 1968. The Porto Marghera group’s original contribution was based on the thesis of the inherent noxiousness of capitalist work and an antagonistic-transformative approach to capitalist technology. This led to the proposal of a counterpower able to determine “what, how, and how much to produce” on the basis of common needs encompassing the environment, pointing to the utopian prospect of struggling for a different, anti-capitalist technology, compatible with the sustainable reproduction of life on the planet.</jats:p>",SS,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11186-021-09441-5,1
